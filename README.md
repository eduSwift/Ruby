5. `Front-end`: you really know a lot of stuff at this point and you can code well-structured, persistent & smart software. But the problem is... the interface. It's still our good old terminal. Wouldn't it be great to play with a nicer interface such as a HTML file with nice CSS design and JS animations? Let's learn about HTML, CSS & get the best practices in web-design (e.g. learning positioning & layout techniques in CSS + very recent stuff like flexbox & CSS animations). Then, we'll teach you how to use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), a nice CSS/JS library to save time when prototyping web-apps. Le Wagon's front end module is very dense, and you'll quickly jump to more advanced stuff such as ERB templates & SASS code. Very professional stuff here! In the second part of the front end module, we'll see the basics of JavaScript to play with the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) and listen to events on web pages. After that, we'll move to AJAX, this technology to make HTTP requests in JavaScript.

6. `Rails`: Time to put all our skills together and move to Rails. No big deal here, we already know most of it. We know DB and Active Record, we are Ruby experts, we've played with dozens of gems and we already have good skills in front end development! The first Rails part will teach you all the core notions of the framework (routing, controllers, models, views). During the second part, **you'll code Airbnb from scratch**. You'll work in teams and you'll learn to collaborate on GitHub using pull requests. You'll learn a lot from this experience, and you'll create your first real professional web-appliction deployed on Heroku.

7. `Projects`: This is the moment of truth! Let's code your own project during the last module and build an awesome product!

## Typical day

- **9h00-10h30**: morning lecture by the lead teacher with lots of live-demo to help you understand the concepts using practical examples.
- **10h30-12h30**: pair-programming session, work on the challenges & push your solutions on Kitt.
- **14h00-17h30**: finish your challenges of the day with your buddy.
-  **17h30-19h00**: "live-code session". The teacher introduces a new challenge in front of the class and solves it **from scratch** with the help of the class.

Every day, there's 5 to 10 different challenges with their own test suite, and additional optional challenges for the fastest students.
